# Software Testing Fundamentals
One of the most important thing that every developer should take care about is
**quality of his own code**. So we have to answer a question: 
>  How to create basic tests that will validate our code during development cycle.

This module will not cover the whole testing methodology, as it would require 
months of learning. Instead we are going to briefly introduce you to the 
fundamentals of _unit testing_ which are one of the simplest and 
the most efficient tools to use by the developers.

Some of the topics that are going to be explained during this module are:
- overview of testing principles and techniques
- TDD
- built-in testing libraries
